# Introduction
This web application is based on Aladdin (An application from Datalogic Scanning) to configurate Datalogic Barcode Scanner. This web app doesn't need barcode scanner connect directly to computer, it's main function is generating barcode (128 barcode / datamatrix barcode) for Datalogic's barcode scanner.

I built this project for Datalogic during my fresher period. I started to build this web app after 1 month learning web development. At the beginning everything was a mess, after that it became more organize as my web development skills has become better. At the time i publish this, the application's functionalities are completely done but the UI is somehow considered not good-looking. I worked alone on this project so it may take a huge amount of time to refactor code, so i think it's okay as long as this web app serves the main goal of this project.
