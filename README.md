# Introduction
This web application is based on Aladdin ( A application from Datalogic Scanning ) to configurate Datalogic Barcode Scanner. This web app doesn't need the scanner conect directly to computer, it's main function is generating barcode ( 128 barcode / datamatrix barcode ).

I built this project for Datalogic during my fresher period. I started to build this web app after 1 month learning web development. At the beginning everything was a mess, after that it became more organize as my web development skills has become better. At the time i publish this, the application's functionalities are completely done but the UI is somehow considered not good-looking. I worked alone on this project so it may take a huge amount of time to refactor code, so i think it's okay as long as this web app serves the main goal of this project.
